        <p>
          My name is Liam Wilson, i was born december 22 2001 in Roberts Creek
          on the sunshine Coast. my family is from Hatfield England on my
          mothers side and Windsor Ontario on my dads. i lived on the sunshine
          coast for 18 years where worked and finished highschool, after
          highschool i did a year of electrical work and when i turned 20 i
          moved to Victoria where i did wearhouse managment for a big appliance
          company. after a year of doing that work i decided i wanted to go to
          school for something i acctually am passionate about and moved backk
          to the sunshince coast for a few months till i moved to vancouver for
          school at BCIT. And now that i am in vancouver im
          <strong>very excited</strong> to start my new life in the city and at
          BCIT.
        </p>
        <p class="p2">So far in my time at BCIT, my favorite course is my Web Dev class as it is the most engaging and entertaining of all my classes. I really enjoy my other classes too but I find that the Web Dev class makes me feel the most like I'm actually doing something and feel the most satisfied after my hard work.
